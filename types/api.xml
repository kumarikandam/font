  <method name="font">
    <arg string name="url">
      The full url of the web-font to load, e.g.,
      `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?display=swap&family=Limelight`.
    </arg>
    <arg type="Object" name="defaultRanges" opt>
      When the stylesheet was loaded before body was parsed, there's no way for the script to know which fonts to load based on `unicode-range` property of the `@font-face`. By passing an object with ranges, only specific fonts will be preloaded. Must be an object in the following format:
      ```js
      { 'U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD': true }
      ```
    </arg>
  </method>
